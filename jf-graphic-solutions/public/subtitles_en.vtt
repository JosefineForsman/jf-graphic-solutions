00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, Samster's hybrid panels are a perfect fit because they help

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
heat up, giving a higher COP for the heat pump system.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I had read about Samster's solar hybrid panels and understood that this was a great solution.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Together with the other solar panels, it reduces consumption and

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
saves the environment. This will increase my COP to extract more

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
energy from my existing heat pump. Yes, now with children and grandchildren,

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
one becomes somewhat influenced by environmental issues, which perhaps we of the older

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
generation haven't taken so seriously before, so it feels like making

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
a small contribution to that as well. Not just for the wallet.
